# Features:

## Find text content in the selection
Content Master will search through your selection and find all unique pieces of text content. It will then display these in a searchable list, allowing you to select and replace multiple items at once.

## Replace content with data
Replace the selected text layers with real data like name, email address, physical address, company name, date, and lorem ipsum.

## Create custom content with variables
Use static strings and dynamic data variables to create the content you need.

#How to use
1. Select layers in Figma
2. Launch Content master
3. Select text content in the searchable list
4. Use quick replace cards or type text with variables in the Custom text field
5. Optionally change variables settings below the variables buttons
6. Hit Replace


*To refresh the searchable list just select layers in Figma and hit Reload.*
